## Maximizing utility of Renewable energy

Machine Learning has become a tool for strategic planning and policy making in the renewable energy sector. It has widespread applications in this sector. The solutions currently in place range from demand and supply forecasting, determination of plant location and size to maximize energy production to smart grid management. Supply forecasting has been very critical to promoting other developments as wind and solar power can be erratic based on weather conditions. A supply shortage from renewable sources would imply reliance on conventional sources of energy.

An important application that can be developed would be to estimate required energy storage in order to limit reliance on conventional (fossil fuels) sources of energy. This solution would be useful given excess energy enervated is wasted, which can be stored and consumed in times of excess demand and lower energy generation.


## Solution to predict wastage of energy and propose investment in energy storage

It is important to understand that this solution is built upon existing machine learning solutions that predict supply from different energy sources such as solar and wind power. 

The model will use past weather and power generation data in order to predict wastage of energy (generated from renewable energy sources.) This in turn will be analyzed to assess the appropriate investment into energy storage solutions weighing it against the cost of generating the needed power from conventional sources of energy.

## An end.

The rapid pace of climate change and the depletion of fossil fuels makes it imperative for us to invest in increasing the efficiency and utility of the renewable energy sources. This will ensure an energy secure future by enabling a transition to a fully decarbonised energy production and consumption. Solving energy problems directly relates to improving living conditions particularly in developing countries.
