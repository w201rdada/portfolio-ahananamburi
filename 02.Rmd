## Maximizing utility of Renewable energy

Machine Learning has widespread applications in the renewable energy sector. They range from demand and supply forecasting to determination of plant location and size to maximize energy production. An important application that can be build on the existing solutions would be to predict investment into energy storage in order to limit reliance on conventional (fossil fuel) sources of energy. 

## A middle.

The model will use past weather and power generation data in order to predict wastage of energy generated from renewable energy sources.  This in turn will be analyzed to assess the appropriate investment into energy storage solutions weighing it against the cost of generating the needed power from conventional sources of energy. 


```{r experimental,echo=F,results='asis',eval=F}
data.table::fread('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCB-MIDS/experiments-causality/master/data/GerberGreenBook_Chapter3_Donations.csv?token=ABNmuX-Q14rzQ4teItDenc9L5Wo2flncks5ZL5qEwA%3D%3D') %>% stargazer::stargazer(type = 'html',title = 'Something from W241 Experiments and Causality')
```

## An end.

The rapid pace of climate change and the depletion of fossil fuels makes it imperative for us to invest in increasing the efficiency and utility of the renewable energy sources. This will ensure an energy secure future.
