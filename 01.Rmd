Machine Learning for Financial Analysis

## Problem 
Financial analysis in the banks and other loan underwriters can be greatly transformed through machine learning. Loan products such as credit cards are plagued by both credit (default) losses. Credit losses can be attributed to companies incorrectly providing higher credit lines to customers or pricing the products very low. 

## Solution
Predictive models built on customer data such as age, education, current debt etc will enable improved calculation of consumer risk. Machine learning can further leverage historical data to improve the precision of the models and the rules, such that when a new customer applies the model will help suggest products and the pricing. 

## Consequences
The implementation of machine learning models in the financial industry can help companies improve their profitability by reducing their credit and fraud losses. The models will enable better product pricing for a given customer. These models can be further leveraged by marketing teams to appropriately position the plethora of products offered by the company.
