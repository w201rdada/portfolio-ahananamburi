	abstract = {Electrical power generation is changing dramatically across the world because of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to introduce mixed energy sources. The power network faces great challenges in transmission and distribution to meet demand with unpredictable daily and seasonal variations. Electrical Energy Storage (EES) is recognized as underpinning technologies to have great potential in meeting these challenges, whereby energy is stored in a certain state, according to the technology used, and is converted to electrical energy when needed. However, the wide variety of options and complex characteristic matrices make it difficult to appraise a specific EES technology for a particular application. This paper intends to mitigate this problem by providing a comprehensive and clear picture of the state-of-the-art technologies available, and where they would be suited for integration into a power generation and distribution system. The paper starts with an overview of the operation principles, technical and economic performance features and the current research and development of important EES technologies, sorted into six main categories based on the types of energy stored. Following this, a comprehensive comparison and an application potential analysis of the reviewed technologies are presented.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.procs.2014.09.060},
	abstract = {Pricing in the online world is highly transparent \& can be a primary driver for online purchase. While dynamic pricing is not new \& used by many to increase sales and margins, its benefit to online retailers is immense. The proposed study is a result of ongoing project that aims to develop a generic framework and applicable techniques by applying sound machine learning algorithms to enhance right price purchase (not cheapest price) by customers on e-commerce platform. This study focuses more on inventory led e-commerce companies, however the model can be extended to online marketplaces without inventories. Facilitated by statistical and machine learning models the study seeks to predict the purchase decisions based on adaptive or dynamic pricing of a product. Different data sources which capture visit attributes, visitor attributes, purchase history, web data, and context understanding, lays a strong foundation to this framework. The study focuses on customer segments for predicting purchase rather than on individual buyers. Personalization of adaptive pricing and purchase prediction will be the next logical extension of the study once the results for this are presented. Web mining and use of big data technologies along with machine learning algorithms make up the solution landscape for the study.},
